# Q* Learning with FrozenLake 4x4 

In this Notebook, we'll implement an agent <b>that plays FrozenLake.</b>

The goal of this game is <b>to go from the starting state (S) to the goal state (G)</b> by walking only on frozen tiles (F) and avoid holes (H). However, the ice is slippery, **so you won't always move in the direction you intend (stochastic environment)**

## Important note 🤔
<b> You can run it on your computer but it's better to run it on GPU based services</b>, personally I use Microsoft Azure and their Deep Learning Virtual Machine (they offer 170$)
https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/microsoft-ads.dsvm-deep-learning
<br>
⚠️ I don't have any business relations with them. I just loved their excellent customer service.

If you have some troubles to use Microsoft Azure follow the explainations of this excellent article here (without last the part fast.ai): https://medium.com/@manikantayadunanda/setting-up-deeplearning-machine-and-fast-ai-on-azure-a22eb6bd6429

## Prerequisites 🏗️
Before diving on the notebook **you need to understand**:
- The foundations of Reinforcement learning (MC, TD, Rewards hypothesis...) [Article](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/an-introduction-to-reinforcement-learning-4339519de419)
- Q-learning [Article](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/diving-deeper-into-reinforcement-learning-with-q-learning-c18d0db58efe)
- In the [video version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2ZOEFAaaI0)  we implemented a Q-learning agent that learns to play OpenAI Taxi-v2 🚕 with Numpy.

## Step -1: Install the dependencies on Google Colab


```
!pip install numpy
!pip install gym
```

## Step 0: Import the dependencies 📚
We use 3 libraries:
- `Numpy` for our Qtable
- `OpenAI Gym` for our FrozenLake Environment
- `Random` to generate random numbers


```
import numpy as np
import gym
import random
```

## Step 1: Create the environment 🎮
- Here we'll create the FrozenLake 8x8 environment. 
- OpenAI Gym is a library <b> composed of many environments that we can use to train our agents.</b>
- In our case we choose to use Frozen Lake.


```
env = gym.make("FrozenLake-v0")
```

## Step 2: Create the Q-table and initialize it 🗄️
- Now, we'll create our Q-table, to know how much rows (states) and columns (actions) we need, we need to calculate the action_size and the state_size
- OpenAI Gym provides us a way to do that: `env.action_space.n` and `env.observation_space.n`


```
action_size = env.action_space.n
state_size = env.observation_space.n
```


```
# Create our Q table with state_size rows and action_size columns (64x4)
qtable = np.zeros((state_size, action_size))
print(qtable)
```

## Step 3: Create the hyperparameters ⚙️
- Here, we'll specify the hyperparameters


```
total_episodes = 20000       # Total episodes
learning_rate = 0.7          # Learning rate
max_steps = 99               # Max steps per episode
gamma = 0.95                 # Discounting rate

# Exploration parameters
epsilon = 1.0                 # Exploration rate
max_epsilon = 1.0             # Exploration probability at start
min_epsilon = 0.01            # Minimum exploration probability 
decay_rate = 0.005            # Exponential decay rate for exploration prob
```

## Step 4: The Q learning algorithm 🧠
- Now we implement the Q learning algorithm:
  ![alt text](http://simoninithomas.com/drlc/Qlearning//qtable_algo.png)



```
# List of rewards
rewards = []

# 2 For life or until learning is stopped
for episode in range(total_episodes):
    # Reset the environment
    state = env.reset()
    step = 0
    done = False
    total_rewards = 0
    
    for step in range(max_steps):
        # 3. Choose an action a in the current world state (s)
        ## First we randomize a number
        exp_exp_tradeoff = random.uniform(0, 1)
        
        ## If this number > greater than epsilon --> exploitation (taking the biggest Q value for this state)
        if exp_exp_tradeoff > epsilon:
            action = np.argmax(qtable[state,:])
            #print(exp_exp_tradeoff, "action", action)

        # Else doing a random choice --> exploration
        else:
            action = env.action_space.sample()
            #print("action random", action)
            
        
        # Take the action (a) and observe the outcome state(s') and reward (r)
        new_state, reward, done, info = env.step(action)

        # Update Q(s,a):= Q(s,a) + lr [R(s,a) + gamma * max Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)]
        # qtable[new_state,:] : all the actions we can take from new state
        qtable[state, action] = qtable[state, action] + learning_rate * (reward + gamma * np.max(qtable[new_state, :]) - qtable[state, action])
        
        total_rewards += reward
        
        # Our new state is state
        state = new_state
        
        # If done (if we're dead) : finish episode
        if done == True: 
            break
        
    # Reduce epsilon (because we need less and less exploration)
    epsilon = min_epsilon + (max_epsilon - min_epsilon)*np.exp(-decay_rate*episode) 
    rewards.append(total_rewards)
    

print ("Score over time: " +  str(sum(rewards)/total_episodes))
print(qtable)
```

## Step 5: Use our Q-table to play FrozenLake ! 👾
- After 10 000 episodes, our Q-table can be used as a "cheatsheet" to play FrozenLake"
- By running this cell you can see our agent playing FrozenLake.


```
env.reset()

for episode in range(5):
    state = env.reset()
    step = 0
    done = False
    print("****************************************************")
    print("EPISODE ", episode)

    for step in range(max_steps):
        
        # Take the action (index) that have the maximum expected future reward given that state
        action = np.argmax(qtable[state,:])
        
        new_state, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
        
        if done:
            # Here, we decide to only print the last state (to see if our agent is on the goal or fall into an hole)
            env.render()
            if new_state == 15:
                print("We reached our Goal 🏆")
            else:
                print("We fell into a hole ☠️")
            
            # We print the number of step it took.
            print("Number of steps", step)
            
            break
        state = new_state
env.close()
```


```

```
